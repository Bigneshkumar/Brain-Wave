    title: 'Finding My Voice Through Anxiety',
    author: 'Sarah M.',
    content: `I used to think anxiety was my enemy, but I've learned it's actually trying to protect me. Last year, I was so overwhelmed with college applications that I couldn't sleep or eat properly. I felt like I was drowning.

The turning point came when I started using mindfulness techniques and talking to a counselor. I learned that my anxiety wasn't something to fight against, but something to understand and work with.

Now, I still get anxious, but I have tools to manage it. I practice deep breathing, keep a journal, and remind myself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. I'm not "cured," but I'm learning to live with anxiety in a healthier way.

To anyone struggling: you're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve support.`,

    title: 'Breaking the Perfectionism Cycle',
    author: 'Alex K.',
    content: `Perfectionism nearly broke me in high school. I thought if I wasn't perfect, I was worthless. Every grade, every project, every social interaction had to be flawless.

It took a mental health crisis for me to realize this wasn't sustainable. I was exhausted, isolated, and constantly disappointed in myself.

Recovery has been about learning to embrace "good enough." I started setting realistic goals, celebrating small wins, and accepting that mistakes are part of learning.

The hardest part was changing my inner dialogue. Instead of "I'm such a failure," I learned to say "I'm learning and growing." It's still a work in progress, but I'm so much happier now.`,

    title: 'Social Media Detox Changed My Life',
    author: 'Jordan T.',
    content: `I didn't realize how much social media was affecting my mental health until I took a break. I was constantly comparing myself to others, feeling inadequate, and spending hours scrolling mindlessly.

The first week without Instagram and TikTok was hard. I felt disconnected and bored. But gradually, I started noticing things I'd been missing - sunsets, conversations with friends, my own thoughts.

When I came back to social media after a month, I had a completely different relationship with it. I unfollowed accounts that made me feel bad, limited my screen time, and started following mental health advocates instead.

Now I use social media intentionally, not compulsively. It's a tool, not a crutch.`,

    title: 'Learning to Say No',
    author: 'Maya P.',
    content: `I used to say yes to everything. Every club, every favor, every social event. I thought being busy meant being successful and liked.

But I was burning out. My grades suffered, my friendships became superficial, and I lost touch with what I actually enjoyed.

Learning to say no was terrifying at first. I worried people would think I was selfish or lazy. But the opposite happened - people respected my boundaries, and the relationships that remained became deeper and more meaningful.

Now I prioritize my time and energy. I choose activities that align with my values and goals. It's not selfish to protect your mental health.`,
